# Program Title (edit this)

Put your program description here.

/*In our project we decided to make something based off the famous game, Crossy Road. Our game is very similar in sorts of it’s goals and objectives. When you are initially put into the game, you are given small instructions, then you are required to click a button which brings you to the level select. Depending on the level, the speed is either faster or slower than the previous or next level. We decided to put the player as a basic circle, while the obstacles are bigger circles that fall randomly at different speeds.
The objective of our game, in terms of Crossy Road. Is to make sure you don’t get hit by the bigger circles, and make it across the whole screen without getting hit, if you get hit by the circles, you lose a life. And if you lose all 3 of your lives, you will get a death screen and you will be sent back to the main menu. If you make it across, let’s say level 1, a screen saying “You win!” will show up and you will get sent back to the main screen where you can do the next level. Our movement uses WASD in terms of up, down, right and left to move the circle. We don’t really have a scoring system however after you beat a level it will show a “You win!” sign. 
Some limitations are that there are only a specific amount of levels, and you dont gain anything when you win.
